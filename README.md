# WeatherData 

**WeatherData** is an iOS application project developed in Swift, designed to handle and store weather data efficiently using Apple's Core Data framework. This project focuses on building a robust data model to manage weather-related information, enabling both data persistence and retrieval for iOS devices.

## Features
- **Swift-based Development**: The entire application is built using Swift, ensuring compatibility with modern iOS frameworks.
- **Core Data Integration**: Utilizes Core Data for local data storage, leveraging an `.xcdatamodeld` file to define the structure of weather data.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Users can store and retrieve weather information even after the app is closed, thanks to Core Data's managed object model.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large amounts of weather data with minimal performance overhead.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiessen2003/weatherdata.git

### Open in Xcode:
- Navigate to the `.xcdatamodeld` file within the HWCIS1951 folder and open it in Xcode to view and manage the data model.

### Build and Run:
- You can build and run the project on any iOS simulator or device for testing purposes.

## Usage

### Weather Data Storage:
- The app allows for storing weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and other metrics.

### Core Data Customization:
- Modify or extend the `.xcdatamodeld` structure to accommodate additional types of weather data.

### Data Persistence:
- Users will experience seamless data persistence, with weather data stored locally for future sessions.
